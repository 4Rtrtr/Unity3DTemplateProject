# Unity3D project template.

# TODO: Fill project description here.

# Note:
Do not forget to mention about /scripts/setup_project.command. This setup script already was called during creation of this new project.
But when this repo will be ready for other users they must use the following:

git lfs clone url
./scripts/setup_project.command windows

And for Mac:
git lfs clone url
./scripts/setup_project.command mac

git lfs clone loads lfs-project more faster than usual clone. setup_project.command installs git hooks and adjust local git config to cover Unity workflows.
